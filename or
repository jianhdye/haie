# Coding Interview University

> I originally created this as a short to-do list of study topics for becoming a software engineer,
> but it grew to the large list you see today. After going through this study plan, [I got hired
> as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon](https://startupnextdoor.com/ive-been-acquired-by-amazon/?src=ciu)!
> You probably won't have to study as much as I did. Anyway, everything you need is here.
>
> I studied about 8-12 hours a day, for several months. This is my story: [Why I studied full-time for 8 months for a Google interview](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13)
>
> **Please Note:** You won't need to study as much as I did. I wasted a lot of time on things I didn't need to know. More info about that below. I'll help you get there without wasting your precious time.
>
> The items listed here will prepare you well for a technical interview at just about any software company,
> including the giants: Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.
>
> *Best of luck to you!*
